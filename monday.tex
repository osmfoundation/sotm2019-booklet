  Qwant Maps: Geocode the World with OSM Data%
}{%
}{%
  A geocoder's purpose is to transform a textual user query into geographical coordinates.
  This task is complex for several reasons. Firstly, because the user query is freeform and may
  come with abbreviations, typography errors, different format standards etc. Secondly, no
  omniscient gazetteer exists to take into account of the complexity of the world
  administrative zones. We present some techniques used by Qwant Maps search engine to
  fulfil user needs.%

  The Next Generation of Mappers:\linebreak Learning from YouthMappers~\noVideo%
}{%
}{%
  What does it take to build a new generation of mappers ready to solve
  challenges within their community? This presentation will feature students
  from YouthMappers sharing how they are deciding what issues to map,
  engaging and training new mappers, especially women, and using map data to
  advocate for change in their local and global communities. Learn how you
  can plan your next mapping initiative with youth at the forefront.

  The following YouthMappers will speak during this session:

  The OpenStreetMap provides probably the most comprehensive digital path network for pedestrians,
  which had been largely unused in its actual depth of detail so far. Based on findings from the
  TERRAIN project, this talk will go into detail how this network can be used for roadside-aware
  pedestrian navigation efficiently, and what challenges and mappings problems occurred.
  Furthermore, specific needs of various person groups will also have to be considered facing
  variable data quality.%

  Caretography~-- Mapping Difficult\linebreak Issues with OSM during Difficult Times%
}{%
}{%
  We map because we care to represent the world. Yet maps are never ``true'', they are shaped by their
  creators and their circumstances. Map-making is world-making: Maps by different authors can give
  access to different worlds. So how can we make, share, and use maps that are created \emph{by} these
  worlds, and not just by a privileged few? How can vulnerable communities influence how they’re
  represented and affected by our maps?%

  New Processes to Agree on Tagging Suggestions and Their Interaction with the Editing Software Available\linebreak on openstreetmap.org~\noVideo%
}{%
}{%
  Tags are only helpful if one can understand what they mean.
  However, it is rather difficult to figure out the tag semantics,
  and there is no agreement how to agree on the semantics.
  The public communication channels mailing list and wiki discussions both
  have relatively low attendance.
  An incident gave rise to the rumour that in fact editing software
  developers were unilaterally controlling tags.

  In this session the results of an open discussion before the
  conference will be presented,
  and attendees can contribute further thoughts during the event.
  The basic idea is to prioritise what most likely helps to get feedback
  from much more of the mappers using the tags.
  If you want to contribute beforehand, please send your suggestions to
  the talk@ or tagging@ mailing list, or email the host directly
  at roland.olbricht@gmx.de.

  Access to Prosperity: Quantifying Infrastructure Impact with OSM%
}{%
}{%
  In many regions of the world a population’s access to essential services is unduly constrained by
  a lack of proper infrastructure. By performing accessibility analysis using OSM data, we can
  understand how route infrastructure impacts access to essential services and use that information
  to inform an intervention.

  This talk explores accessibility analysis performed to understand the impact of footbridge
  construction in Eswatini and introduces a python framework enabling users to perform similar
  analyses.%

  Replacing the classic ``Continue for about 200 m then turn left'' by guidance instructions in more
  natural language automated from landmarks are still a research topic but aims to allow users to
  move with more confidence. The objective is to test it on an indoor/outdoor pedestrian route
  calculator. Anything that can be used as a landmark is extracted from OpenStreetMap, then
  categorised and classified to annotate the route: relevance, visibility, relative position etc.%
