  Exploring Interactions between the Academic and Mapping Communities in OpenStreetMap
}{%
  This talk presents an initial inquiry into the relations between the academic and mapping
  communities in OpenStreetMap, based on a review of recent publications, interviews of colleagues,
  and self-reflection of the authors. By this, we aim to understand how and when research-community
  interactions come to be, what is their nature, and how these can be improved and made more
  productive for both sides.

  OpenStreetMap as a Space~\noVideo
}{%
}{%
  Can OSM be used in classroom teaching as a definitive instance of a geographic space? We provide
  instances of how OSM as space may be of interest to researchers and for students of geography
  alike. Concepts of human geography manifested in OSM can be used to understand how digital
  geographies and offline activities are intrinsically interwoven with and influenced by each other.
  Thus, introduction to digital geography in classrooms can be through concepts in human geography.

  This study examines OpenStreetMap data quality at different stages of a participatory mapping
  process developed for understanding inequalities in healthcare access of informal urban residents

  Oh no, not that API 0.7 talk again
}{%
  Our data model is impractical. You know that. Even OGC Simple Features are better. Changesets and
  versions promised easier reverting — is it simple yet? We have added a lot of features to API 0.6
  over the past ten years, but should we have? Let's see what went wrong and what we can improve.%

  Assessing the Completeness of Urban Green Spaces in OpenStreetMap
}{%
}{%
  OpenStreetMap provides a lot of valuable information about urban green spaces, but the numerous
  and conceptually overlapping OSM tags that describe such features lead to spatially heterogenous
  representations in OSM. We developed an exploratory data analysis methodology to identify locally
  relevant OSM tags for mapping green spaces in a specific area and compared the extracted OSM
  features to administrative data to evaluate the level of completeness in regard to urban green
  spaces.
