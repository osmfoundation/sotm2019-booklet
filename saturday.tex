  \emph{Keynote} Open up! Why digital mobility needs participation%
}{%
}{%
  Baden-Württemberg’s Ministry of Transport aims at developing regional mobility data towards an
  open and interoperable framework for new mobility solutions~-- as part of a sustainable traffic
  system, realising efficiency, climate protection and living quality. On the way there, fair
  chances for innovation are key: Not only for better results but also for the involvement of most
  different societal actors. Cross-thinking and open innovation are cornerstones in such a process.%
