\section*{Welcome to Heidelberg and State of the Map 2019} \label{welcome}
This booklet provides you essential information
about the conference, the location and the schedule.  We are proud of the participation of the
OpenStreetMap community and our rich program but there is even more!  Please do get involved and
take advantage of the off-schedule sessions, discussions and spaces.

\paragraph*{Help desk} \label{welcome-helpdesk}
You already know the help desk, located on the ground floor of the Chemie-Hörsaalgebäude (Chemistry
Lecture Halls Building). It is also your port of call if you need support or help.

\paragraph*{Programme}
You can find the diverse programme on page~\pageref{saturday}f. Full abstracts of all talks are
available at https://2019.stateofthe\\map.org/program for the general tracks and
https://2019.stateofthemap.org/academic\_programme for the academic track.

\paragraph*{Self-organised sessions} \label{welcome-location}
Rooms A, B and C in the Mathematikon building are available for self-organised sessions if they are not in use by pre-schedule sessions (see this booklet). Please come to the help desk in the Chemie-Hörsaalgebäude to announce your session.
